                                    <p>Event Organisers do not need their own payment gateway to utilise the Kepasa
                                        payment processing option. Bookings placed online will be processed by Ngoma
                                        Digitech and income less applicable service fees and/or commissions will be

                                        (online bookings). Handling Ticket Buyer card details and using the Kepasa
                                        Merchant Services for in-house bookings is in breach of these terms and
                                        conditions. If an Event Organiser would like to accept credit/debit cards as

                                <p>The varying exchange and refund policies set forth by our Event Organisers
                                    prohibit Ngoma Digitech from issuing exchanges or refunds after a booking is

                                    is advised to contact the Event Organiser directly to process their request as
                                    per the Event or Venue's own exchange and refund policy.</p>

                                <p>The ticket processing fee is non-refundable if an Event Organiser processes the
                                    refund. The ticket processing fee is only refundable if an event is cancelled or

                                    circumstances beyond Ngoma Digitech's control), Ngoma Digitech will refund the

                                        payments on behalf of Event Organisers when you purchase tickets online.</p>

                                        specify:</p>

                                        payment, you must not use the "back" button on your browser as this may
                                        cause you to lose your ticket selection or result in a duplicate booking.
